## 🧠 Overview
This Worker uses **Cloudflare’s Llama 3.1 8B Instruct** model to answer course-related questions based on data from Piazza.

When a user asks a question:

1. The Worker retrieves all stored Piazza posts from KV (`piazza_data`).
2. It scores and ranks posts by token overlap with the query (including replies and follow-ups).
3. It builds a compact context block of the top 10 relevant posts.
4. It sends that **retrieved Piazza context** to `@cf/meta/llama-3.1-8b-instruct-awq`.
5. The model generates an answer strictly from that context and cites relevant post IDs.
